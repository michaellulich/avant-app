# README

Thanks for taking a look at my Avant-App. This app is built using Ruby on Rails with a PostgreSQL database.

If you don't have rails, in console,

`gem install rails`

then:

`git clone https://github.com/michaellulich/avant-app.git`

then start your rails server:

`rails s`

and go to:

`localhost:3000/api/cardholders`

Thanks!
